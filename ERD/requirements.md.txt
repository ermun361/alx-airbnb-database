# Entity-Relationship Diagram

This ERD illustrates the relational database structure for the Airbnb clone project. It contains six key entities — Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, and Messages — along with their attributes and relationships.

The diagram follows relational database best practices and emphasizes data integrity using foreign keys and indexed fields.
